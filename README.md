**HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is the standard markup language used to structure the content and layout of web pages. It provides the foundation for creating the user interface and defining the structure of the web application.

**CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is used for styling and presentation. It determines the visual design, layout, and appearance of the web application, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

**jQuery:** jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript library that simplifies tasks like DOM manipulation, event handling, and AJAX interactions. It streamlines the process of working with HTML documents and enhances the efficiency of JavaScript code.

**Bootstrap:** Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides pre-designed UI components, responsive grid systems, and CSS styling. It facilitates the creation of a consistent and visually pleasing user interface while ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.

*These technologies, when combined, enable the development of a dynamic, user-friendly, and visually appealing web application that provides an enhanced user experience.*
